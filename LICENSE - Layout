The layout itself is not patented and due to keyboard layouts not being creative enough, copyright doesn't apply.
I would however really appreciate attributions to epigeos.com and Kirki Walkowiak. It'd also be very nice if it was kept under the name HEDTU everywhere and no other, even similar layout was named the same. I'd also be really happy if I was notified when this layout is used in other projects.
